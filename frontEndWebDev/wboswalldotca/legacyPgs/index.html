				<h2>About Me </h2>

				<p>Hello! I'm William Boswall.  I'm from PEI, Canada.  I decided to create this website to showcase my knowledge,<wbr> skills, portfolio and what I am currently working on.</p>
				
				<p>For all of my life I have been interested in computers and sometimes I wondered away to other things but always come back to computers or electronics.<wbr> 
					I've always tinkered with them but back in 2012 after doing 2 upgrades on my math skills, <wbr> I decided to take an interest in programming and webdesign.
				</p>

				<p>I took courses in both software and an entry level hardware course at Holland College.  However I wouldn't recommend that college because when I had a question during a Java final <wbr> 
					exam and I asked the instructor to clarify the question, He served me a letter stating that I was being forced out and to leave the premisis immediately.  <wbr>
					I was shocked and went straight to Student Services and they just laughed at it and did damage control.  <wbr>
					I  was so devastated that I couldn't look at any thing technology related or even read a book for fun.  <wbr>
					I didn't get any support to switch to another discipline but rather my College account was deleted and I was out $15,000CDN and my entire life ruined.  <wbr>
					I couldn't rely on my BA from UPEI since that never got me an entry job in Sociology.  So UPEI failed at helping me through their so called career counselling. <wbr>  I have contacted Skills PEI, Career Development Services and Career Bridges but all have declined due to legal repercussions. 
					<wbr> Not sure what the legal repercussions but I guess they will tell you anything to get paid to do nothing.  <wbr>
				
				<p>The best advice I can give anyone that is either thinking of coming to PEI is to not bother.  The markets are small and limited and also there is no health care and the education is deplorable (homeschooling is the best) <wbr> 
					and there never was high quality one-tier healthcare, education and amongst the other services that the Island Government so call offers. <wbr> 
					If your an immigrant then you are welcomed but if your not then you have to look at other provinces or even internationally.  <wbr>
					If your from PEI and living on PEI, and finding that it's hard to find a stable and a job that evolves into a career then you may have to look off Island and possibly internationally.<wbr>
					That's what I am currently working on.  One thing that I have noticed over the years is that regardless if the person is an Islander, Canadian or an Immigrant, they all use PEI as a jumping off spot to learn and just get a job to pay the bills and then upon completion of the program <wbr> 
					then they leave and go and settle in another Canadian province or somewhere else. 
				</p>

				<p>I was just afraid and lost and no one wanted to help me get my life on track but rather ridicule and harass me. Just totally alone and betrayed for the infinite time. <wbr>
					However, sadly that's just life and it's normal unfortunately for people to act like that even family and relatives. Even people at your job will do that. <wbr>
					Only way to deal with that is to simply ignore them and move on with your life and leave them in the dust.  You can't fix stupid.  <wbr>
					I then sank into a deep depression had severe mental break downs.  <wbr>
					However this month of December 2022, I have been making some accomplishments that has been helping me with my self esteem and confidence.  <wbr>
					I have tried to contribute to open-source software on github but have been denied and my pull requests deleted.  <wbr>
					I also have been posting to stack over flow but have been voted down.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another piece of advice is to decide on not one career but at least two or maybe three careers and make sure they all somehow relate to each other and study those trends for your chosen career paths. <wbr>
					However it is good to take the job bank assessment  or a career assessment that's available from your federal / state/ or provincial government. <wbr>
					A quick search will give you several free career assessments. <wbr> 
					This assessment will give you a report on what your skills and interests are and how they relate to the careers that best suit your skills and interests.<wbr>
					Then print off this assessment and then go and make an appointment with your career counseller (one that will actually not waste your time and will actually help you) <wbr> 
					and also don't forget to bring your own work with you including your resume.  This will help the process move a little more quickly and efficiently.  
				</p>

				<p>Most importantly always seek help when your mental health or even your overall health deterates to the point that immediate help is needed. <wbr>
					Make sure that you are getting seen reguarly and that proper notes are being made during each appointment until you feel that you are actually better.  <wbr>
					That you can continue on a better lifestyle.
